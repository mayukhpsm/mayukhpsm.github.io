**Background**

Dr Som Bhatia was watching the lush green yet deserted playgrounds of Eco Park from his white Audi while cruizing along biswas bangle sarani that connected NSCBI Airport with Saltlake Sector V via New town in the City of Joy, Kolkata. 

He turned towards Dr Anisha Roy and said: *Can you just imagine an empty Eco park in the middle of May, when most of the schools are enjoying summer vacation?* 

Dr Anisha silently nodded her head. Kolkata was not new to her since she was born in a house on Amherst Street. However, her mind was preoccupied with the problem posed by Dr Bhatia. He is the director of a multi-speciality hospital called ICS which had branches in Dum-Dum, Howrah and Salt-lake. Although, the hospital treated patients of all illnesses, their Salt lake branch had speciality in Bariatric Surgery and ICS was a very popular hospital among Kolkatans. On an average, they conducted 200 bariatric surgeries every month and were in the process of increasing the monthly capacity to 400 bariatric surgeries. But suddenly on April 2020, as per Government instructions, their Salt lake branch was designate as one of the COVID treatment centres.

**Case Scenario**

There are many decisions that Dr Som has to take âˆ’ whether to use package pricing or traditional pricing for covid treatment? Should package pricing be offered to all types of treatments if they plan to have package pricing strategy? How should one come up with the package pricing and how to use package pricing as a competitive strategy in the market since he was expecting many new hospitals to come up in Kolkata in the next couple of years.
