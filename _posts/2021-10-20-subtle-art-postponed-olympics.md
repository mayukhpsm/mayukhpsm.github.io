Tokyo 2020 became the first postponed game in the Olympics history. In this article, we discuss how various stakeholders of Olympic Committee worked with the host Country to successfully conduct a multi-billion dollar event in midst of a pandemic. We start the article by discussing the standard route of winning the proposal and subsequent planning that went for a decade prior to organizing the event. Then we discuss how the entire plan went for a toss due to the postponement of the event to 2021, which led to the formation of Here-We-Go Task-force and eventually mitigating the risks using the Tokyo-Model. Finally, we summarize the key lessons learnt from this postponement and how it developed a robust blueprint for future Olympics hosting countries.
