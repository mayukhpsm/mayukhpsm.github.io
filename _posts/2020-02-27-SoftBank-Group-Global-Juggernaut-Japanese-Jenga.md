In this case study, we trace the journey of Masayoshi Son, towards his grand vision of taming the global information revolution, using Softbank Group (SBG). We divide this journey into three chapters. In the first chapter, we delve into his inspiration. In the next chapter, we see the birth of Softbank, while applauding his risky endeavor and learning from his embarrassing failures. In the final chapter, we end up with an awe towards his risk-laden steps in embracing the challenges of globalizing SBG using his vision fund.
