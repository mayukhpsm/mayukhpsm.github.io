As we move past COVID-19, telephone medicine and telemedicine is becoming integral to patientâ€™s clinical care for both primary and specialty care. In this paper we discuss the difference between telemedicine, telehealth, telephone medicine, and direct-to-consumer telemedicine. Then we state the difficulties that differentiate an office visit from telephone medicine appointment. We also identify three root causes of medical errors in telehealth that leads to malpractice lawsuit. We supplement our review with three retrospective mini-cases to summarize the lessons learned in a direction to minimize risk arising in clinical management due to telemedicine.
