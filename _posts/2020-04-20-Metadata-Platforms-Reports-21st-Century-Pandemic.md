With the outbreak of COVID-19, we are experiencing an avalanche of information from various platforms to fight against this pandemic. Although a good thing at the time of such crisis, it is becoming overwhelming for researchers to differentiate between legitimate literature for academic pursuit against tabloid information and fake news. To combat this dilemma, this list of 21 web links has been curated that provides meta-information and reporting insights from worldwide credible primary and secondary sources. It is to be noted that this list is by no means completely exhaustive, yet provides a sufficient base for researchers to start off with literature search for further results and innovations specific to COVID-19 pandemic.
